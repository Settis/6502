This was started as a self-educational project.
To understand how computer works I decided to create one.
The main rule here is that I should understand each bit, each connection.
I try to build it from scratch as much as possible.

I've started with a 6502 compatible CPU in Logisim [avaialbe here](/logisim/README.md).

Currently, I'm trying to build the real one around 65c816 CPU. 
As an example of how it looks you can see it working with three character displays running Wozmon:
